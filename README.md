[Prospects of Formal Mathematics](https://www.mathematics.uni-bonn.de/him/programs/current-trimester-program/him-trimester-program-prospects-of-formal-mathematics)
programme.

1. The prototype from the work with Jacob Collard and Eswaran Subrahmanian is at http://www.jacobcollard.com/parmesan2/ 
We have preprints:
https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11577 Mathematical Entities: Corpora and Benchmarks,
https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06699 Parmesan: mathematical concept extraction for education, 
https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13830 Extracting Mathematical Concepts from Text

2. The prototype from the work with Lucy Horowitz on a glossary for undergraduate mathematics is at MathGloss https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/database
   A newer prototype glossary dealing with Category Theory and built from textbooks from Leinster, Goldblatt and Riehl is at https://mathgloss.github.io/CatGloss/database.
    
The original preprint is https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12649 MathGloss: Building mathematical glossaries from text
